## Difference for Humans
It is easier for humans to read `1 month ago` compared to 30 days ago. This is a common function seen in most date libraries so I thought I would add it here as well. The lone argument for the function is the other Carbon instance to diff against, and of course it defaults to `now()` if not specified.

This method will add a phrase after the difference value relative to the instance and the passed in instance. There are 4 possibilities:

- When comparing a value in the past to default now:
    * 1 hour ago
    * 5 months ago
- When comparing a value in the future to default now:
    * 1 hour from now
    * 5 months from now
- When comparing a value in the past to another value:
    * 1 hour before
    * 5 months before
- When comparing a value in the future to another value:
    * 1 hour after
    * 5 months after

You may also pass `CarbonInterface::DIFF_ABSOLUTE` as a 2nd parameter to remove the modifiers ago, from now, etc : `diffForHumans($other, CarbonInterface::DIFF_ABSOLUTE)`, `CarbonInterface::DIFF_RELATIVE_TO_NOW` to get modifiers agoor from now, `CarbonInterface::DIFF_RELATIVE_TO_OTHER` to get the modifiers beforeor after or `CarbonInterface::DIFF_RELATIVE_AUTO` (default mode) to get the modifiers either ago/from now if the 2 second argument is null or before/after if not.

You may pass `true` as a 3rd parameter to use short syntax if available in the locale used : diffForHumans($other, `CarbonInterface::DIFF_RELATIVE_AUTO, true)`.

You may pass a number between 1 and 6 as a 4th parameter to get the difference in multiple parts (more precise diff) : `diffForHumans($other, CarbonInterface::DIFF_RELATIVE_AUTO, false, 4)`.

The `$other` instance can be a DateTime, a Carbon instance or any object that implement DateTimeInterface, if a string is passed it will be parsed to get a Carbon instance and if `null` is passed, `Carbon::now()` will be used instead.

To avoid having too much argument and mix the order, you can use the verbose methods:

* shortAbsoluteDiffForHumans(DateTimeInterface | null $other = null, int $parts = 1)
* longAbsoluteDiffForHumans(DateTimeInterface | null $other = null, int $parts = 1)
* shortRelativeDiffForHumans(DateTimeInterface | null $other = null, int $parts = 1)
* longRelativeDiffForHumans(DateTimeInterface | null $other = null, int $parts = 1)
* shortRelativeToNowDiffForHumans(DateTimeInterface | null $other = null, int $parts = 1)
* longRelativeToNowDiffForHumans(DateTimeInterface | null $other = null, int $parts = 1)
* shortRelativeToOtherDiffForHumans(DateTimeInterface | null $other = null, int $parts = 1)
* longRelativeToOtherDiffForHumans(DateTimeInterface | null $other = null, int $parts = 1)

> PS: $other and $parts arguments can be swapped as need.

```php
// The most typical usage is for comments
// The instance is the date the comment was created and its being compared to default now()
echo Carbon::now()->subDays(5)->diffForHumans();               // 5 days ago

echo Carbon::now()->diffForHumans(Carbon::now()->subYear());   // 11 months after

$dt = Carbon::createFromDate(2011, 8, 1);

echo $dt->diffForHumans($dt->copy()->addMonth());                        // 1 month before
echo $dt->diffForHumans($dt->copy()->subMonth());                        // 1 month after

echo Carbon::now()->addSeconds(5)->diffForHumans();                      // 4 seconds from now

echo Carbon::now()->subDays(24)->diffForHumans();                        // 3 weeks ago
echo Carbon::now()->subDays(24)->longAbsoluteDiffForHumans();            // 3 weeks

echo Carbon::parse('2019-08-03')->diffForHumans('2019-08-13');           // 1 week before
echo Carbon::parse('2000-01-01 00:50:32')->diffForHumans('@946684800');  // 50 minutes after

echo Carbon::create(2018, 2, 26, 4, 29, 43)->longRelativeDiffForHumans(Carbon::create(2016, 6, 21, 0, 0, 0), 6); // 1 year 8 months 5 days 4 hours 29 minutes 43 seconds after
```
You can also change the locale of the string using `$date->locale('fr') before the diffForHumans()` call. See the [localization](https://carbon.nesbot.com/docs/#api-localization) section for more detail.

Since 2.9.0 diffForHumans() parameters can be passed as an array:

```php
echo Carbon::now()->diffForHumans(['options' => 0]); // 0 seconds ago
echo "\n";
// default options:
echo Carbon::now()->diffForHumans(['options' => Carbon::NO_ZERO_DIFF]); // 1 second ago
echo "\n";
echo Carbon::now()->diffForHumans(['options' => Carbon::JUST_NOW]); // just now
echo "\n";
echo Carbon::now()->subDay()->diffForHumans(['options' => 0]); // 1 day ago
echo "\n";
echo Carbon::now()->subDay()->diffForHumans(['options' => Carbon::ONE_DAY_WORDS]); // yesterday
echo "\n";
echo Carbon::now()->subDays(2)->diffForHumans(['options' => 0]); // 2 days ago
echo "\n";
echo Carbon::now()->subDays(2)->diffForHumans(['options' => Carbon::TWO_DAY_WORDS]); // before yesterday
echo "\n";

// Options can be combined with pipes
$now = Carbon::now();

echo $now->diffForHumans(['options' => Carbon::JUST_NOW | Carbon::ONE_DAY_WORDS | Carbon::TWO_DAY_WORDS]); // just now
echo "\n";

// Reference date for differences is `now` but you can use any other date (string, DateTime or Carbon instance):
$yesterday = $now->copy()->subDay();
echo $now->diffForHumans($yesterday); // 1 day after
echo "\n";
// By default differences methods produce "ago"/"from now" syntax using default reference (now),
// and "after"/"before" with other references
// But you can customize the syntax:
echo $now->diffForHumans($yesterday, ['syntax' => CarbonInterface::DIFF_RELATIVE_TO_NOW]); // 1 day from now
echo "\n";
echo $now->diffForHumans($yesterday, ['syntax' => 0]); // 1 day after
echo "\n";
echo $yesterday->diffForHumans(['syntax' => CarbonInterface::DIFF_ABSOLUTE]); // 1 day
echo "\n";
// Combined with options:
echo $now->diffForHumans($yesterday, [
    'syntax' => CarbonInterface::DIFF_RELATIVE_TO_NOW,
    'options' => Carbon::JUST_NOW | Carbon::ONE_DAY_WORDS | Carbon::TWO_DAY_WORDS,
]); // tomorrow
echo "\n";

// Other parameters:
echo $now->copy()->subHours(5)->subMinutes(30)->subSeconds(10)->diffForHumans([
    'parts' => 2,
]); // 5 hours 30 minutes ago
echo "\n";
echo $now->copy()->subHours(5)->subMinutes(30)->subSeconds(10)->diffForHumans([
    'parts' => 3, // Use -1 or INF for no limit
]); // 5 hours 30 minutes 10 seconds ago
echo "\n";
echo $now->copy()->subHours(5)->subMinutes(30)->subSeconds(10)->diffForHumans([
    'parts' => 3,
    'join' => ', ', // join with commas
]); // 5 hours, 30 minutes, 10 seconds ago
echo "\n";
echo $now->copy()->subHours(5)->subMinutes(30)->subSeconds(10)->diffForHumans([
    'parts' => 3,
    'join' => true, // join with natural syntax as per current locale
]); // 5 hours, 30 minutes and 10 seconds ago
echo "\n";
echo $now->copy()->subHours(5)->subMinutes(30)->subSeconds(10)->locale('fr')->diffForHumans([
    'parts' => 3,
    'join' => true, // join with natural syntax as per current locale
]); // il y a 5 heures, 30 minutes et 10 secondes
echo "\n";
echo $now->copy()->subHours(5)->subMinutes(30)->subSeconds(10)->diffForHumans([
    'parts' => 3,
    'short' => true, // short syntax as per current locale
]); // 5h 30m 10s ago
// 'aUnit' option added in 2.13.0 allows you to prefer "a day", "an hour", etc. over "1 day", "1 hour"
// for singular values when it's available in the current locale
echo $now->copy()->subHour()->diffForHumans([
    'aUnit' => true,
]); // an hour ago

// Before 2.9.0, you need to pass parameters as ordered parameters:
// ->diffForHumans($other, $syntax, $short, $parts, $options)
// and 'join' was not supported
```
If the argument is omitted or set to null, only Carbon::NO_ZERO_DIFF is enabled. Available options are:

- Carbon::ROUND / Carbon::CEIL / Carbon::FLOOR (none by default): only one of the 3 can be used at a time (other are ignored) and it requires 'parts' to be set. By default, once the diff has as parts as 'parts' setting requested and omit all remaining units.
    * If Carbon::ROUND is enabled, the remaining units are summed and if they are >= 0.5 of the last unit of the diff, this unit will be rounded to the upper value.
    * If Carbon::CEIL is enabled, the remaining units are summed and if they are > 0 of the last unit of the diff, this unit will be rounded to the upper value.
    * If Carbon::FLOOR is enabled, the last diff unit is rounded down. It makes no difference from the default behavior for diffForHumans() as the interval can't have overflow, but this option may be needed when used with CarbonInterval::forHumans() (and unchecked intervals that may have 60 minutes or more, 24 hours or more, etc.). For example: CarbonInterval::make('1 hour and 67 minutes')->forHumans(['parts' => 1]) returns "1 hour" while CarbonInterval::make('1 hour and 67 minutes')->forHumans(['parts' => 1, 'options' => Carbon::FLOOR]) returns "2 hours".
- Carbon::NO_ZERO_DIFF (enabled by default): turns empty diff into 1 second
- Carbon::JUST_NOW disabled by default): turns diff from now to now into "just now"
- Carbon::ONE_DAY_WORDS (disabled by default): turns "1 day from now/ago" to "yesterday/tomorrow"
- Carbon::TWO_DAY_WORDS (disabled by default): turns "2 days from now/ago" to "before yesterday/after
- Carbon::SEQUENTIAL_PARTS_ONLY (disabled by default): will keep only the first sequence of units of the interval, for example if the diff would have been "2 weeks 1 day 34 minutes 12 seconds" as day and minute are not consecutive units, you will get: "2 weeks 1 day".

Use the pipe operator to enable/disable multiple option at once, example: `Carbon::ONE_DAY_WORDS | Carbon::TWO_DAY_WORDS`

You also can use `Carbon::enableHumanDiffOption($option)`, `Carbon::disableHumanDiffOption($option)`, `Carbon::setHumanDiffOptions($options)` to change the default options and `Carbon::getHumanDiffOptions()` to get default options but you should avoid using it as being static it may conflict with calls from other code parts/third-party libraries.

Aliases and reverse methods are provided for semantic purpose:

- from($other = null, $syntax = null, $short = false, $parts = 1, $options = null) (alias of diffForHumans)
- since($other = null, $syntax = null, $short = false, $parts = 1, $options = null) (alias of diffForHumans)
- to($other = null, $syntax = null, $short = false, $parts = 1, $options = null) (inverse result, swap before and future diff)
- until($other = null, $syntax = null, $short = false, $parts = 1, $options = null) (alias of to)
- fromNow($syntax = null, $short = false, $parts = 1, $options = null) (alias of from with first argument omitted unless the first argument is a DateTimeInterface, now used instead), for semantic usage: produce an "3 hours from now"-like string with dates in the future
- ago($syntax = null, $short = false, $parts = 1, $options = null) (alias of fromNow), for semantic usage: produce an "3 hours ago"-like string with dates in the past
- toNow($syntax = null, $short = false, $parts = 1, $options = null) (alias of to with first argument omitted, now used instead)
- timespan($other = null, $timezone = null) calls diffForHumans with options join = ', ' (coma-separated), syntax = CarbonInterface::DIFF_ABSOLUTE (no "ago"/"from now"/"before"/"after" wording), options = CarbonInterface::NO_ZERO_DIFF (no "just now"/"yesterday"/"tomorrow" wording), parts = -1 (no limits) In this mode, you can't change options but you can pass an optional date to compare with or a string + timezone to parse to get this date.
